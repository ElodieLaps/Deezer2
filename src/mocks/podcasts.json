         "description": "cd2titres est un podcast de passionné qui s’adresse à toutes celles et tous ceux qui veulent apprendre d’où viennent les tubes qui ont bercé leurs années 90 et 2000, quel a été leur impact et quel est leur héritage aujourd’hui.  ​ J'analyse les hits de la période 96 à 2003, celle de mon adolescence, et ceux qui les font : création, promotion, succès ou échec, en m’intéressant au contexte de la chanson et à la place de celle-ci dans la carrière de son interprète.  J’étudie aussi les rouages de l’industrie du disque alors à son apogée et bousculée par l’évolution des modes de consommation au début du XXIème siècle.    De Madonna à Kylie Minogue, des Spice Girls à Britney Spears, toutes les plus grandes icônes de la pop sont là, mais je n’oublie pas pour autant les étoiles filantes qui n’ont pas connu de grande carrière malgré des hits inoubliables.   Ponctuellement je reçois des invité·e·s, journalistes ou podcasters, mais aussi artistes qui reviennent avec moi sur les traces de leurs œuvres passées et partagent leurs souvenirs de l’époque.   Ici, on aime la pop et les artistes qui la font, sans aucune forme de plaisir coupable ! Alors bienvenue ! ",

         "description": "We Don't Wanna Grow Up is a nostalgic podcast about pop culture, toys and fond memories of the 80s, 90s and 00s. We want to take you back to that feeling of strolling down the aisles at Toys R Us, flipping through the J.C. Penney catalog so you can ear-mark everything you want for Christmas, cozying up in front of the television on a Saturday morning with a big bowl of cereal, or waiting hours for a certain song to play on the radio so you can hit record on your tape player and have the song forever. We want to recapture the feeling of the moment your dELiA*s catalog arrived in the mail, looking at the album art in your new CD and sitting on your inflatable furniture. Remembering all of this has been a comfort and has helped us get through the stress and anxiety that has come along with everything happening in the world lately, and we hope it helps you a little bit, too.",

With the emphasis on bringing together like-minded musical legends with slightly left of centre leanings, Ralph's podcast is about unique pairings and agenda-setting topics of conversation. The lead figure will always be a key figure from dance music: icons like Norman Cook, Pete Tong and The Black Madonna among them as well as key global artists like Cassy, Phantasy boss Erol Alkan and premiere leagues producers such as Stuart Price and Flood. They are often paired with people from the art, fashion and film worlds, or activists and collaborators close to their hearts - people who can spark ideas, debate and create great conversation. The podcast has been driven to the heart of the matter by Acetate's Ralph Moore, a journalist, A&R and manager with over two decades of industry experience under his belt. It's all about the road less travelled and the road to electronic enlightenment, with surprises and curveballs along the way.",

DJ, producer, remixer and radio host. His 360° introduction to electronic music never stopped to progress during the time without leaking his Techno origins. Born in Italy and adopted in Greece, Robert’s approach to decks started in 1999 in Turin area (Italy) performing on Sunday afternoon parties mainly playing Trance and Minimal. In summer 2000 won the “Dance On The Beach” contest in Thessaloniki (Greece) as the youngest DJ ever. From then he had the opportunity to perform for many years all around Italy alongside many of the most famous DJs from the Italian underground scene.
